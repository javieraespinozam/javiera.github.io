# Desalination Plant Project — Valparaíso Region, Chile

## Overview
This repository presents the Environmental Engineering project developed at **Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (USM)** for the course *MEC385 – Environmental Engineering*.  
The study proposes the design, construction, and operation of a **seawater desalination plant** located in **Puchuncaví, Valparaíso Region, Chile**.  
The facility is designed to produce **1,000 L/s** of potable and industrial water through **reverse osmosis**, ensuring sustainable water availability for industrial, agricultural, and community use.

The project was conceived as a response to the prolonged **megadrought** affecting central Chile since 2010, providing a replicable model for sustainable water management in regions facing hydric stress.

## Motivation
Chile is facing one of the most critical water shortages in Latin America.  
- 37 of 38 municipalities in the Valparaíso Region are officially under water scarcity.  
- The Aconcagua River Basin is approaching an “extreme hydric stress” condition.  
- Approximately 99% of the national water supply depends on surface and groundwater sources.

This project aims to:
- Guarantee long-term water security for industrial, agricultural, and human consumption.
- Reduce dependency on overexploited rivers and aquifers.
- Integrate sustainability, technology, and environmental protection into water production systems.

## Technical Scope

### Process Description
1. **Seawater Intake:** Offshore towers capture up to 1.44 m³/s each, minimizing marine ecosystem impact.  
2. **Pre-Treatment:** Mechanical filtration, ultrafiltration, and controlled chemical conditioning.  
3. **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** High-pressure membrane separation to remove salts and impurities.  
4. **Post-Treatment:** Water remineralization and stabilization to meet potable standards.  
5. **Brine Management:** Controlled discharge through optimized diffusers in compliance with Chilean environmental regulations.

### Infrastructure Sectors
- **Marine Works (OM):** Seawater intake and discharge systems.  
- **Land Pipelines and Electrical Lines (EITL):** Conveyance of seawater and electrical energy.  
- **Plant Sector:** Main desalination and control facilities.  
- **Power Supply Line (LEAP):** 110 kV connection to the Marbella–Quillota grid.  
- **Aqueduct Sector:** Transport of desalinated water to Quillota and regional reservoirs.

## Environmental Analysis

### Identified Environmental Impacts
| Environmental Component | Description | Mitigation Measures |
|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Marine Ecosystems | Possible salinity increase from brine discharge | Continuous salinity monitoring, optimized diffusers |
| Air Quality | Temporary emissions (NO₂, SO₂, CO₂) during construction | Low-emission equipment, dust suppression systems |
| Noise and Vibration | Heavy machinery during construction | Compliance with Chilean acoustic regulations |
| Soil and Flora | Localized degradation and vegetation removal | Native species replanting and soil recovery programs |
| Water Resources | Temporary turbidity during river crossings | Controlled flow diversion and monitoring programs |

### Environmental Management
- Continuous monitoring of discharged brine quality and marine biodiversity.  
- Fauna relocation and vegetation recovery plans.  
- Emission reduction measures for construction and operational stages.  
- Periodic auditing in compliance with **Law No. 19.300 (Environmental Framework Law)** and **Environmental Evaluation Service (SEA)** guidelines.

## Sustainability and Innovation
Given the plant’s estimated **26.3 MW** energy demand, multiple renewable energy alternatives were analyzed:
- **Solar photovoltaic systems** for daytime operation.
- **Wind turbines** leveraging coastal wind potential.
- **Wave and tidal energy** for hybrid integration.

Optimization strategies include:
- Enhanced **energy recovery devices** within the reverse osmosis units.
- Reduction of **brine discharge volume** through reuse and evaporation.
- Integration of desalination processes with **aquaculture and industrial reuse systems**.

## Economic and Social Impact
- **Investment:** USD 162 million.  
- **Construction Workforce:** Average 1,102 workers; peak 1,633.  
- **Operational Workforce:** 40 permanent employees.  
- **Regional Impact:** Job creation, local water security, and industrial resilience.

The project demonstrates a public–private innovation model, contributing to Chile’s sustainable industrial development and long-term environmental resilience.
